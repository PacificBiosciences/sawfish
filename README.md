<h4 align="center">Joint structural variant and copy number variant caller for HiFi sequencing data</h4>

Sawfish is a joint structural variant (SV) and copy number variant (CNV) caller for mapped HiFi sequencing reads. It
discovers germline structural variants from local sequence assembly and jointly genotypes these variants across multiple
samples. Sawfish additionally applies copy number segmentation on each sample's sequencing coverage levels,
synchronizing structural variant breakpoints with copy number change boundaries in the process to improve classification
of breakpoint-based structural variant calls, in addition to calling copy number variants.

Key features:
- Combined assessment of all large variants in each sample.
  - Sawfish provides a unified view of both SVs and CNVs in each sample, with redundant calls merged into single
    variants describing both breakpoint and copy number detail.
- High SV discovery and genotyping accuracy
  - All breakpoint-based structural variants are modeled and genotyped as local haplotypes, yielding substantial
    accuracy gains on modern SV truth sets such as the GIAB HG002 T2T SVs.
- High resolution
  - All breakpoint-based structural variants are assembled to basepair resolution and reported with breakpoint homology
    and insertion details.
- Integrated copy number segmentation
  - Integrated copy number segmentation with GC-bias correction is used to: (1) call CNVs independent of any breakpoint
    support, and (2) improve the classification of large structural variant deletion and duplication calls, any such
    calls lacking consistent depth support are reclassified as breakends.
- Simple multi-threaded workflow
  - A single command-line is used for each of the discover and joint-call steps

Breakpoint-based SVs are reported as deletions, insertions, duplications and inversions when supported by the
corresponding breakpoint and depth pattern, otherwise the breakpoint itself is reported. Copy number variants are
reported as deletions and duplications. The minimum variant size is 35 bases (configurable) . There are no restrictions
on maximum SV or CNV size.
